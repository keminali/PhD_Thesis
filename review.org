Review from Dr. Avital

* Chapter 1

Please see attached for my comments.

You should write in a way that is aimed towards someone who knows the field, but knows nothing about your project.

Please update your thesis, send it to the QM printer for two copies which we will send as *informal* copies of your thesis to the examiners. 

They may choose to ignore it and just look at the copies sent by the centre. 
Nevertheless, it will at least give a good impression with them that you are dedicated to your studies.
