	b  CFD 
		1) Turbulent flow simulation brief review[only brief review on DNS, LES and DES, as you have not used them in the project]
		2) Turbulent flow modelling
			a) RANS and URANS
			b) The global rotating grid and local sliding grid approaches
                                 [The global rotating grid is good for free space problems involving only the rotor and the sliding grid is more general and good for simulating the rotor+pylon and in confined space as including free surface waves and sea floor,
                                   but requires more computational resources]
